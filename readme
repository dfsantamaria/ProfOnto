Prof-Onto

Prof-Onto is a domotic system based on the ontology OASIS - an Ontology for Agent Systems and Integration of Services 
(http://www.dmi.unict.it/~santamaria/projects/oasis/oasis.php)- and exploiting  Phidias - PytHon Interactive Declarative 
Intelligent Agent System (https://github.com/corradosantoro/phidias) - 

Version 0.1. In the current version, Prof-Onto is a domotic simulation enviroment, i.e, no physical devices can be actually connected but
communications are emulated via OWL serialized files.

  "Towards an Ontology-Based Framework for a Behavior-Oriented Integration of the IoT, by Domenico Cantone, Carmelo

1) Download. 
   1.1)Use git clone or download the source code from GitHub.

2) Setup. 
   2.1) Make sure that Python, Maven, and Java are in your system path.
   2.2) Locate and run the "setup.py" file in the folder "main". Wait for the installation and make sure maven terminates without errors.
   2.3) You can now delete the folder "src". All required files are in the folder "target"

3) Running.   
        
   3.1) The file "main-beta.py" in the folder "target/python" runs a beta version of the domotic assistant. Currently it can 
         - install and uninistall devices;
         - add and remove users;
         - add and remove configurations.
         - add, remove, and retrieve believes.
         - simulate the execution of simple requests.
         
         Run the file "main-beta.py" and wait for it to load. 
         
   3.2.A) Then, run the file "client-test.py" in "target/python/test". It  will add a device, a user, a configuration, request a simple task 
        and then it will remove the device, the configuration,  and the user previously added.
         
        Or
        
   3.2.B) Run the file "rasb-light-agent-beta.py" in "target/python" that simulate a rasberry PI working with OASIS and type the following 
          command:
          
          -> start           # to start the application that will listen on localhost, port 8000. To change address and port modify the ontology
                             # rasb-lightagent.owl in "target\ontologies\test\rasb"
   
          -> set hub [address] [port] # to specify the address and port of the assistant that by default is set to localhost, 8000
          -> install                  # to show the behavior of the agent to the assistant
          
          From now on, any compatible request will be displayed by the agent with a print.
          
          -> uninstall #to remove the behavior of the agent from the assistant knowledge base
          
          -> stop   # to disconnect the client.
